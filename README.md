# Credit card form filler for scam websites
## Description
The goal of this project is to automatize the filling of fake information in websites that try to steal credit cards card information, and fill their database with as much garbage as possible without being obvious.

My idea was to avoid alerting them that most of the information is garbage, but to make their data unreliable for as long as possible.
